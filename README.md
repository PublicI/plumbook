Plum Book
===========

This repository contains data from the 2012 and 2016 editions of the Plum Book, which is published by the Government Printing Office. From [its description](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012/content-detail.html): "Every four years, just after the Presidential election, the United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions, commonly known as the Plum Book, is published, alternately, by the Senate and the House. The Plum Book is used to identify presidentially appointed positions within the Federal Government."

The 2012 and 2016 data is contained in individual YAML and JSON files for each position. The data comes from [the mobile app version of the Plum Book](http://m.gpo.gov/plumbook/). For 2012, it does not include positions that are filled by career incumbents (hence the gap in file names). For 2016, it includes those positions.

These files and the data they contain are generated by the federal government and are in the public domain.
